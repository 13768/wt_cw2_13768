# Bookiv - book review app

This is an app to share reviews for books. Users can choose any book to write a review from the collection of 30 books. The app allows to keep track of the reviews and enables updating, creating, deleting and reading of the reviews. The app also allows filtering or searching for specific books based on keywords in the title of the books since it might be troublesome to find books in a large collections without searching. Validation is done both in the backend and the front end. In the front end it is done by adding required tags to the input fields and in the back end it is done by specific error messages. You can see examples of validation in the search function.
